# Lauren Voigt Fine Art Website

This repository contains the source code for the **Lauren Voigt Fine Art** website, a React-based project showcasing artwork, exhibitions, and custom work. The site includes features such as galleries, slideshows, video loops, and responsive layouts optimized for various devices.

## Features

- **Custom Artwork Galleries**: Display artwork in organized, responsive galleries.
- **Exhibition Information**: Showcase upcoming and past exhibitions.
- **Video Loops**: Highlight artwork with looping videos.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
- **Dynamic Components**: Includes reusable components like slideshows and static image viewers.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: Frontend framework for building the user interface.
- **CSS Modules**: Scoped styling for components.
- **HTML5 Video**: Used for video loops and galleries.
- **JavaScript**: For interactivity and dynamic content.
- **Create React App**: Bootstrapped the project for development.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified, and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

## Project Structure
Certainly! I'll create a more tailored README.md file for your project while retaining any relevant information from the current boilerplate. Here's an updated version:
